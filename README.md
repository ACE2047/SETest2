# Description
This project involved creating and managing a Git repository, implementing test case workflows, and updating project documentation. The project was initially created in IntelliJ IDEA, where the repository was also initialized. Afterward, a README.md file was added directly on GitHub to document the project. A project board was created on GitHub to track progress, organizing tasks into categories such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

The initial commit included the provided project files, serving as the foundation for further work. Five test case issues were created on GitHub, each describing a specific test case with pre-provided solutions. The first test case was demonstrated as an example. For each test case, a new branch was created, and the corresponding implementation was added. Once completed, pull requests were made and merged into the main branch.

Throughout the process, the project board was regularly updated to reflect the status of each task, ensuring clear documentation of progress. Finally, the README.md file was updated to include details about the tools used, the tasks completed, and developer information. This workflow highlighted the integration of IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub to manage the project efficiently.
